                    <p>DeFlix changes the funding dynamic to allow for <b>riskier, creative content.</b> The risk of
                        investment
                        is
                        decentralised between many parties with no minimal requirements. The filmmakers' intellectual
                        property
                        is protected via smart contracts. This allows audiences and investors to directly fund the
                        content
                        they
                        wish to see made without intermediaries.</p>

                    <p><b>There is a trust problem in film funding.</b> The industry is very opaque as the fundamental
                        investment
                        is intellectual property which has a 0 marginal cost of duplicating. </p>

                    <p>There are many creative and competent filmmakers who are unable to secure funding since studios
                        are
                        <b>unwilling to take risks</b>. This problem is further compounded through <b>Netflix's
                            dominance and
                            reliance
                            on algorithmic content.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p>The process of raising funding heavily relies not only on filmmakers delivering, but also on the
                        <b>potential investors</b> (namely large production companies and studios) not taking a creative
                        idea
                        and
                        cutting out the originating director or screenwriter. This in turn creates very derivative and
                        "safe
                        content", restarting the cycle.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Deflix solves this through the use of smart contracts and blockchain technology.</b> Smart
                        contracts
                        create a trustless environment without the need for large and expensive legal teams to enforce
                        copyright. Blockchain provides the transparency ever lacking in the budgets.</p>
